# Bank-Marketing-Predictive-Modeling-for-Offer-Acceptance
Addressed imbalanced data using oversampling and applied classification algorithms  (SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict customer responses to offers.   Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Colab
This project builds a complete, production-ready machine learning system to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on data from a Portuguese banking campaign. Inspired by the structure and best practices in the book Designing Machine Learning Systems, this solution includes every stage of an ML lifecycle—from problem framing to deployment readiness.
